## Coding Exercises

A series of coding exercises done on coding platforms like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/diegopetrola/), mostly in **python** and **js**.

### JavaScript usage

Run `npm run test` to test all solved problems or `npm run test -- -g ProblemDescription` to test a problem whose description matches `ProblemDescription`.

Eg: `npm run test -- -g pascal` will show the tests for the function who generates Pascal's Triangle and was used to solve [this problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle/).
